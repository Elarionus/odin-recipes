    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Couscous is an interesting dish, similar to the consistency/style
      of rice. It starts out very hard, but when mixed with water and
      butter, it swells up and gets nice and fluffy. It can be great
      on its own with salt and pepper, but really shines when other
      things are mixed into it.
